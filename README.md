# Illegal Mines in Ghana

 Data Correlation based on Household income, lighting levels and deforestion.

The set contains following projects:

* **MainGLSS.ipynb**: This Notebook is the main data analysis part for the combined data set of income lighting and deforestation.

* **Child Health.ipynb**: This Notebook was started to analyze the child health data set of Ghana. We did not continue on that due to the uncertainty of the reliability and the unexact locations due to privacy concerns.

* **IDEAR.ipynb**: This was using the IDEAR tool that already gives overview metrics for a given dataset. The yaml files describe the different datasets we use. We stopped using it because we encountered on a error in the code.
