# Illegal Mines in Ghana

## Data Correlation based on Household income, lighting levels and deforestion

The set contains following projects:

* **MainGLSS.ipynb**: This Notebook is the main data analysis part for the combined data set of income lighting and deforestation.

* **Child Health.ipynb**: This Notebook was started to analyze the child health data set of Ghana. We did not continue on that due to the uncertainty of the reliability and the unexact locations due to privacy concerns.

* **IDEAR.ipynb, para-glss_sec.yaml, para-glss.yaml**: This was using the IDEAR tool that already gives the the standard overview metrics for a given dataset. We stopped using it midway because it did not seem usefull on a dataset with 700 features. More info on the tool can be found here:
